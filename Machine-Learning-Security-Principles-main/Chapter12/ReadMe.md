# Chapter 12: Embracing  and Incorporating Ethical Behavior
The source code for this chapter demonstrates techniques for sanitizing data as part of an effort to interact with data in an ethical manner. You discover how to modify the dataset such that the loss of data useful for analysis is minimized, yet privacy is maximized. In addition, the sanitization process emphisizes the need to keep bias out of the dataset so that the analysis is useful.

## Dataset used in this chapter
*The dataset used in this chapter is custom to this chapter because it demonstrates constructions that you shouldn’t use in a real world application. All of the values are fictitious and any resemblance to any entity living, real, unreal, dead, or otherwise is purely coincidence. I’m including this note because some people are likely to find the data offensive in some way. I assure you that no offense is intended and that the data is designed to show you what to avoid to keep from offending someone else.*
