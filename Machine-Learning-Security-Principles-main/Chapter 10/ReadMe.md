# Considering the Ramifications of Deep Fakes
This chapter considers what a deep fake is really all about and then provides you with two examples: an autoencoder and a Pix2Pix GAN. There are three source code files that perform these tasks:
* A program to check for GPU support on your system (`MLSec; 10; Check for GPU Support.ipynb`)
* An autoencoder example (`MLSec; 10; Autoencoder.ipynb`)
* A Pix2Pix GAN example (`MLSec; 10; Pix2Pix.ipynb`)
